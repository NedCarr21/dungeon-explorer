# Pokemon Muse

Based on Essentials v18.1

## A) Installation of Game
#### Step 1. Make a GitHub Account
To make a GitHub Account, open github.com and make an account

#### Step 2. Share your Username with Ranko or Bry
This step is done so that we can add access permissions for you to the repo. It doesn't matter if you share it via DM or on the Dev server. We can all see each others' usernames because we are collaborators of the same repo.

#### Step 3: Install GitHub Desktop
This will allow you to interact with the repo using UI instead of complicated command line stuff

#### Step 4: Sign in to your account in GitHub Desktop
*self-explanatory*

#### Step 5: Cloning the Repo
- With GitHub Desktop open, press Ctrl+Shift+O, this will open the "Clone a Repository" popup.
- Select the URL option. Then select the file path. Finally in the URL Field paste in this URL 
- Wait

#### Step 6: Celebrate
Great! Now you have a clone of the Muse Repo.

## B) Updating the Game
#### Step 1: Open GitHub Desktop
*self-explanatory*

#### Step 2: Fetch Origin for Updates
In the Top Bar you should see a "Fetch Origin" button, press it.
- If there are updates that you don't have, the "Fetch Origin" button will now say "Pull Origin", Press it again.
- If there are no updates, the "Fetch Origin" button will have the sub-text "Last fetched just now" and won't change.

#### Step 3: Celebrate
Great! Now you have updated your repo.

## C) Adding your own edits to the Repo
#### Step 1: Open GitHub Desktop
*self-explanatory*

#### Step 2: Make your edits
This can be as big as deleting the entire data folder or something as small as adding a space  to this readme file. (Please don't delete the Data folder lol)
Once the changes have been made, you will see them listed in left side

#### Step 3: Commit the changes to the Repo
Below the listed changes, you will see 2 text fields called "Summary" and "Description". Fill these in appropriately. After that press the blue "commit to master" button below that.
These are used to keep track of the repo history so please make sure these are informative enough that you can understand what they mean at a glance. So no vague summaries like
> "Added Stuff" or "Removed Uncool Thingy"

#### Step 4: Pushing commits to the Repo
The changes you have made rn are only on your PC. You'll need to update the main repo online to reflect those changes. This can be done by pushing the commits to the repo.
- After you're done making commits, check the top bar. You should be able to see the "Push Origin" option. Press it.
- Wait for a few seconds.

#### Step 5: Celebrate
Great! Now you have made changes to the Muse Repo.
